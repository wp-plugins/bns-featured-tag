== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this in more than one widget area? =

Yes, this plugin has been made for multi-widget compatibility. Each instance of the widget will display, if wanted, differently than every other instance of the widget.

= How can I style the plugin output? =

The plugin uses several "common" WordPress functions that create standard class and id elements that can be styled in the style.css file
* the classes generated by the post_class() function; and, the id generated by "post-" apended to the_ID() function wrap the general post output
* the plugin class `post-details` wraps the general meta details of the post, such as the Author, Categories, Tags, etc.
* the overall plugin may also be wrapped in a widget "container" class, or id, specific to the theme itself such as (but not limited to): widget, sidebar, left, right, etc.

With the addition of the display Tag Description option an additional class was written into the plugin. To style the tag description displayed add the class 'bnsfc-tag-desc' to your style.css file then use your choice of properties to style the text, for example:
`
.bnsfc-tag-desc {font-style: italic;}
`

= Can I increase the maximum posts to display? =

As of version 1.6.2 the Total Posts to Display is independent of the "posts per page" setting as set under Settings | Reading.
