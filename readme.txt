== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this in more than one widget area? =

Yes, this plugin has been made for multi-widget compatibility. Each instance of the widget will display, if wanted, differently than every other instance of the widget.

= How can I style the plugin output? =

The plugin uses several "common" WordPress functions that create standard class and id elements that can be styled in the style.css file
* the classes generated by the post_class() function; and, the id generated by "post-" apended to the_ID() function wrap the general post output
* the plugin class `post-details` wraps the general meta details of the post, such as the Author, Categories, Tags, etc.
* the overall plugin may also be wrapped in a widget "container" class, or id, specific to the theme itself such as (but not limited to): widget, sidebar, left, right, etc.

= Can I increase the maximum posts to display? =

The maximum posts displayed by the widget is controlled by the "posts per page" setting as set under Settings | Reading.
If you wish to increase the total posts displayed by the widget you can increase this number but it will also increase the number of posts displayed by the Loop routine(s).
