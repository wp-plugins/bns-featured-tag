== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Where can I get support for this plugin? =
Please note, support may be available on the WordPress Support forums; but, it may be faster to visit http://buynowshop.com/plugins/bns-featured-tag/ and leave a comment with the issue you are experiencing.

= Can I use this in more than one widget area? =
Yes, this plugin has been made for multi-widget compatibility. Each instance of the widget will display, if wanted, differently than every other instance of the widget.

= How can I style the plugin output? =
The plugin uses several "common" WordPress functions that create standard class and id elements that can be styled in the style.css file

* the classes generated by the post_class() function; and, the id generated by "post-" appended to the_ID() function wrap the general post output
* the plugin class `post-details` wraps the general meta details of the post, such as the Author, Categories, Tags, etc.
* the overall plugin may also be wrapped in a widget "container" class, or id, specific to the theme itself such as (but not limited to): widget, sidebar, left, right, etc.

As of version 1.9, you may create a custom stylesheet using the name `bnsft-custom-style.css`; and save it to the BNS Featured Tag plugin folder.
Elements you add into this file will not be overwritten with future plugin updates. With the addition of the display Tag Description option an additional class was written into the plugin.
To style the category description displayed add the class 'bnsft-tag-desc' to your bnsft-custom-style.css file then use your choice of properties to style the text, for example:
`
.bnsft-tag-desc {font-style: italic;}
`

The following CSS elements are generated by the plugin code:

* .bns-featured-tag
* .bnsft-clear
* .bnsft-content
* .bnsft-link
* .bnsft-tag-desc

Additional style elements may be available but are most likely created through WordPress core functionality, the current active Theme, or another active plugin.

= Can I increase the maximum posts to display? =
As of version 1.6.2 the Total Posts to Display is independent of the "posts per page" setting as set under Settings | Reading.
